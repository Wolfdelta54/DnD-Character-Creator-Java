# DnD-Character-Creator-Java
This is a Dungoens and Dragons Character Creator that was created using a multi-class structure and very simple pre-built Java classes (e.g. Math, Integer, ArrayList, Collections, etc.) and primitive data types. I do know that there are better pre-built or community created classes and libraries that I could use but I started this project before I knew about the numerous community created libraries.

# Recommendations
If you have any recommendations on how I could improve this please contact me at darianlhorn@gmail.com any and all suggestions, tips, bug report, and help will be greatly appreciated as I know that I still have room to improve my knowledge and skills in Java.
