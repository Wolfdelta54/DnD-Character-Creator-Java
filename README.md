# DnD-Character-Creator-Java
This is a Dungoens and Dragons Character Creator that was created using a multi-class structure and very simple pre-built Java classes (e.g. Math, Integer, ArrayList, Collections, etc.) and primitive data types. I do know that there are better pre-built or community created classes and libraries that I could use but I started this project before I knew about the numerous community created libraries.

# Future Updates
I am going to continue working on this program as I have already put a lot of time into it and have grown attatched to it, to a certain extent, and wish to make it as good as I can. I do realize that I will most likely have to re-do the entire program to accomplish some of my goals for it but that is a sacrifice that I should be, and am, willing to make. Below is a list of future updates to the program in no particular order.

1) Add all playable races and classes
2) Add a new class or method that allows the creation of characters higher than first level
3) Move from console display to a UI
4) Create a more user friendly system
5) Add multi-class feature

# Recommendations
If you have any recommendations on how I could improve this please contact me at darianlhorn@gmail.com any and all suggestions, tips, bug report, and help will be greatly appreciated as I know that I still have room to improve my knowledge and skills in Java.
